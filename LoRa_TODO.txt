
Tasks we needs to be done.
Move finished tasks to Done section:

- Check of the MURATA TCXO config is correct
- Make the timers more generic and move the OS code into the HAL layer.
- add support for Arduino - add sx1276-Arduino-hal.h/cpp
- add support for Linux - add sx1276-Linux-hal.h/cpp
- Add support for Cad detection before sending a packet
- Add support to provide the send/receive packet buffer,
  no need to allocate packet data in the sx1276 driver. Can be provided
  Rx/Tx parameters.
- Add support for larger Lora packets (can be up to 2048 bytes)
  this feature is not so important, however the current implementation
  is very basic.



Done:
- Started a Generic SX1276 driver to support all SX1276 modules (May-2017 Helmut)
- Migrated typedefs code into sx1276.h (7-May-2017 Helmut)
- Migrated enum code into sx1276.h/radio.h (7-May-2017 Helmut)
- Verify the Murata ANT Switch code
- MURATA PA_BOOST case,is _antSwitchTXBoost right? (Same as STM sample code)
